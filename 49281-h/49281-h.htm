<p><i>Harry.</i> Beautiful, beautiful! “There’s music in

while I take another of your mother’s delicious fresh
rolls.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Making the sixth you have devoured before
my eyes!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Exactly. What a tribute to her cooking!
She’s the best bred woman in the country. Her pies are
miracles of skill; her rolls are rolls of honor; her golden
butter is so sweet, it makes me sweet upon her.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Well, I declare, Harry Holden, that’s poetry!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Is it? Then hereafter call me the poet of the
breakfast table. My lay shall be seconded with a fresh
egg.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Another? Land sakes! you think of nothing
but eating.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Exactly, when I’m hungry. My hunger once
appeased, I think of this good farm&mdash;the broad fields,
mowing, haying, the well-fed cattle, and sometimes, when
I am <em>very</em> hungry, I think of the time when I leaned
over the fence, and gazed enchanted upon the pretty girl
milking her cow&mdash;whose name was Sally.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Eh&mdash;the cow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Now, Sally, don’t destroy the poetry of my
language.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Don’t be ungrammatical, Harry; and do stop
talking nonsense.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I will, for my breakfast is finished, and I can
talk to you no longer. I’m off. (<i>Sings.</i>)</p>

<p class="uni">(<i>Rises.</i>) Ah, I little dreamed, two years ago, when I
was playing the fine gentleman at Squire Jordan’s,&mdash;a
city swell, up in the country here on a vacation,&mdash;that I
should soon become a farmer.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Are you sorry it is so, Harry?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> (<i>Comes down, places a cricket beside</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>,
<i>and sits on it</i>.) Sorry, you gypsy, when it has made a
man of me? No. It has been my salvation. I have a
fortune left me, and was in a fair way of squandering it
in all the vices of the city; had acquired a taste for hot
suppers, fine wines, gambling, and all sorts of dissipation;
was on the high road to ruin, when some good
angel sent me up here. I saw you, and was saved.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> And you are perfectly contented with your situation?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, no, I’m not. In fact, I’m getting very
much dissatisfied.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Not with me, Harry?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> With you? Bless your dear little heart!
you’re the only satisfaction I have. When I asked the
old gentleman&mdash;your father&mdash;to give you to me, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
years ago, he said, “No, young man. Though I’ve no
doubt you love my Sally, you’ve got too much money.
You never worked a day in your life. Suppose your
wealth should take to itself wings some day, what’s to
become of her? She shall be a farmer’s wife, or die an
old maid. You say you would die for her. Go to work,
learn to run a farm, bring out your muscle, get some color
in that pale face, get rid of your vices, and then, if your
money goes, you’ve the power to earn a living, and a
smart wife to help you.”</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> That’s just what he said, and ’twas good advice.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> It was, though I did not think so at the time.
But I took it, hired out to him, and now thank my good
fortune for the copy he set me.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> And everybody says there’s not a more likely
farmer in the neighborhood than you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Much obliged to everybody. But, Sally, I
think your father is a little selfish.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Don’t abuse father. He’s the most generous
man&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I know. But I’ve grown valuable to him.
And now, when I ask him to let me marry you, he “hems”
and “haws,” and says, “Don’t be in a hurry. Have
patience.” He knows that the moment you are my wife,
I shall pack up and be off; and that’s what’s the matter.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> It will all come right one of these days.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I suppose it will. But it don’t come right
now. I tell you, Sally, I’m going to have an answer this
very day, or to-morrow I’m off.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Off? And leave me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> O, no. Take you with me. You love me&mdash;don’t
you, Sally?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> You know I do, Harry.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Then marry me. I’ll make you the happiest
woman in the world. I’ll carry you to an elegant home,
and scatter money in every direction, to bring around you
luxuries and enjoyments.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> No, Harry; I could enjoy nothing, leaving my
father without his consent. I have always tried to be a
good daughter. He would be very angry, should I disobey
him, and no good fortune would follow me. No,
Harry. Be patient. There’s a good time coming.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, it’s always <em>coming</em>. But I shall ask his
consent to-day.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Do, Harry. I hope he’ll say yes, for you deserve
it. (<i>Puts her arm about his neck.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And you deserve the best husband in the
world, you gypsy. (<i>Puts his arm round her waist, and
kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Christopher Columbus! O, hokey! (<span class="smcap">Sally</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>jump up</i>.) Did you hear it?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> Hear what? Why don’t you frighten a body
to death, and have done with it!</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Somebody fired off something close to my
head. Blunderbuss, I guess. Did it hit you, Sally?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> I didn’t hear anything.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Didn’t you feel it? Must have hit yer right
in the mouth. It’s awful red!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Come, Johnny, there’s enough of that. I don’t
like it.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Don’t you, though? Thought you did.
Seemed to take to it nat’ral nuff. Where’s dad?</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> He is not up yet. (<i>Sits and resumes her work.</i>
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>goes to chair, back, and takes up his hat</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny.</span> Guess he’s kinder sleepy after his jaunt to
the city yesterday. Guess the coppers are hot! O, won’t
he catch it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry.</span> Why, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny.</span> Matter? Say, thought you was goin’ down
with me after that woodchuck this mornin’. Don’t see
what a feller wants to fool away his time here with a gal
for, when there’s a woodchuck to be got so handy.</p>

<p class="center mbt"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Somerby</span>, <span class="smcap1">L.</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> I’ll woodchuck yer! (<i>Taking him by the
ear.</i>) What d’ ye mean by keeping out er the way all the
morning&mdash;hey?</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> O! Quit, now! You hurt!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Hope I do. You jest stir out er this room
till I’ve done with yer, if you dare! (<i>Sits in rocking-chair,
and rocks violently.</i>) Sakes alive! It’s enough to
drive one ravin’ distracted! There’s yer father sleeping
like a log, and it’s arter eight o’clock! Where did you
two critters go yesterday&mdash;hey?</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Went to the city, of course.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Yes, yer did go to the city with a load of live
and dead stuff; and there’s that man in there, with not a
cent in his pocket to show for it. He’d a never got home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at all if the brute in the shafts hadn’t known more than
the brute in the wagon. Drunk clean through!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What! Has Mr. Somerby had another
spree?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> I should think he had! They come thicker
and thicker.&mdash;You young one! you speak up, and tell
me what you know ’bout it, quick!</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Well, all I know, dad an’ I went to market.
He sold off everything, and then sent me down to Scudder’s
to git a new rake, and over to Jinks’s for some
sugar, and round to Stevens’s to borry a screw-driver, cos
something got loose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Somethin’ got loose! I should think so!</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Said he’d wait till I come back. When I
got back, he hadn’t waited; so I went tearin’ round arter
him. Man in a white hat said he saw him goin’ down
onto the wharf to see the elephant; so I went down. Big
crowd down there. They was a auctioneering off a lot
of animals. Lion, tiger, and monkeys&mdash;Jemimy!&mdash;by
the dozen. Purty soon I spied dad. He was sprung.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Sprung? For the land sakes! what’s that?
Not overboard?</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Sprung&mdash;over the bay.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Over the bay? Thought he was on the wharf.
Now, don’t yer lie, you young one!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> He means he was in liquor.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> More likely liquor in him. Why don’t you say
he was drunk, and have done with it?</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Well, he was pretty full; and when I got
there, he was leanin’ up agin a hogshead, and biddin’ on
an elephant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> On an elephant! Why, he might have broke
his neck!</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> O, fush! He was a biddin’ for the elephant.
He offered a hundred dollars. But I didn’t see it; so I
jest took a hold er him, h’isted him inter the wagon, and
drove back to Stevens’s. When I come out, the wagon
and dad were out of sight, and I had to foot it ten miles.
So I jest crept inter the barn when I got here, and had a
snooze on the hay.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Dear me! what capers! Two or three times
a year he has these sprees, and they cost a mint of money.
There was apples and cider, hens and chickens, eggs and
butter, all gone. Dear me, what will become of us? If
there’s anything in this world I detest, it’s a toper!</p>

<p class="right">

<p><i>Sally.</i> Poor mother, she’s in a fever of excitement.
I’ll try and get her to lie down.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> I say, Mr. Holden, it’s purty hard sleddin’

<p><i>Harry.</i> It is, indeed, Johnny; and don’t you make it

<p><i>Johnny.</i> O, don’t you fret about me. I feel bad
enough to see dad on these times. I’m a purty rough
boy, but it does make me feel mean to see dad, who’s
such a smart old gent when he’s sober, let himself out in
this way. I’ve never touched a drop of liquor, and you
can bet your life I never will.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That’s right, Johnny. Drinking is the meanest
kind of enjoyment, and the dearest, too. I’m going
to try and reform the old gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Perhaps not. His bidding for the elephant
has given me an idea.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> It gave me an idea he was purty far gone.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes. We will make him believe he bought
the elephant.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> What good will that do?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I think we’ll turn the animal into a temperance
lecturer. Come with me. Let’s see your mother
and Sally, and arrange matters before your father appears.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Yes. But I want ter go after the woodchuck.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> What matter?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, suppose we call it “consequential damages.”</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> Call it what you like. It’s a big critter, and
should have a big name.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You don’t understand me. I told you Sheriff
Brown was looking for you. There are about a dozen
complaints lodged against you already. This is likely to
be a costly affair.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> Sheriff Brown&mdash;complaints&mdash;costly affair!
Why, what do you mean? Isn’t it bad enough to be
caught with an elephant on your hands?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, your elephant, not being acquainted in
this part of the country, got out of the road a little in
travelling towards his present quarters. For instance, he
walked into Squire Brown’s fence, and carried away about
a rod of it.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> You don’t mean it!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And, in endeavoring to get back to the road,
walked through his glass house, and broke <i>some</i> glass.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> Goodness gracious!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Mr. Benson’s flower garden, being near the
road, was hastily visited by his highness, and a few of
the rare plants will flourish no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> O, my head! Is that all?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No, for Mrs. Carter was on the road with
her span. On the appearance of the great hay-eater, one
of the horses dropped dead.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> O, ruin, ruin! Why didn’t the elephant keep
him company?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> These parties have made complaint, and will
sue you for damages. There are other disasters connected
with the entry of your pet&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> Don’t mention ’em. Don’t speak of any more.
There’s enough now to ruin me. Broken fences, smashed
hot-houses, ruined flower beds, and a dead horse!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Consequential damages.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> Consequential humbugs! I am the victim of
a conspiracy. I don’t own an elephant. I won’t own
him. I never bought him. He’s escaped from a menagerie.
Why should I buy an elephant?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That won’t do, Mr. Somerby. You were
seen at the auction; you were heard to bid for the animal.
I’m afraid you will have to suffer.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> I won’t pay a cent. They may drag me to
jail, torture me with cold baths and hot irons; but not a
cent will I pay for the capers of that elephant.</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> No, no, father; you must not.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Don’t mind ’em, dad; blaze away. (<i>Aside.</i>)
By jinks, that’ll be fun! (<i>They all come forward.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> I’m going to have a shot at the critter, if I die
for it. Here he comes again. (<i>Raises gun.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Mercy sakes, Silas, you’ll kill somebody!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You must not shoot, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> O, father, don’t! Please don’t! (<i>They all seize
him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Blaze away, dad! Give him fits!</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> (<i>Breaking away from them.</i>) Stand back, I
say. (<i>Raises gun.</i>)</p>

<p class="center mbt"><i>Enter the elephant</i>, <span class="smcap1">R.</span></p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> There, darn you! (<i>Fires.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
S.</span> <i>scream</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> O, murther, murther! I’m kilt intirely!</p>

<p><i>Bias.</i> Oo, oo, oo! I’m a gone darky! (<i>The elephant
falls, rolls over, and from the debris</i> <span class="smcap">Bias</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pat</span>
<i>emerge, looking very much frightened</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> (<i>Shaking his fist at</i> <span class="smcap">Silas</span>.) More damages,
be jabers! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.) I didn’t bargain for this at all.</p>

<p><i>Bias.</i> Look&mdash;look er here, old gent; I ain’t game, no
how. Golly! I’m full ob lead!</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> What’s this? Have I been duped?</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Sold again, dad.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> So, so, you’ve been conspiring against me.
There’s no damages, and no elephant. This is your work,
Harry Holden.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> It is, Mr. Somerby. I freely confess my sin.
But I did it for a good purpose. ’Tis true there is no
elephant, save the imitation I have manufactured for the
occasion; but please remember we came very near having
one.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Yes, dad, you bid a hundred dollars.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> I breathe again. You’re right. All this might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have been true, had my folly had its way. Thanks to
Johnny, I was saved. But you carried the joke a little
too far. That gun was loaded.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> Only with powder. I left a charge in it last
Fourth, for the blamed thing kicked so I was afraid of it.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> It’s all right. Sally is yours, Harry, and I’ll
keep my other promise. I suppose these gentlemen were
hired for the occasion.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> By me sowl, not to be peppered at all, at all.</p>

<p><i>Bias.</i> By golly, dat ar charge almost took away my
head.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> So, boys, you got a little more than you bargained
for; but I’ll fix that all right.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> I’ll pay all damages there, glad to get off so
easily in my adventure with the elephant. I’ve one request
to make. Don’t let this story spread.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You can rely upon my silence.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> Marcy sakes, Silas, it ain’t much to boast on!</p>

<p><i>Sally.</i> It shall be a family legend.</p>

<p><i>Pat.</i> Be jabers, I wouldn’t blab till I was deaf and
dumb!</p>

<p><i>Bias.</i> Dis yer pusson can hold his hush.</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> Thank you. And you (<i>to audience</i>), can I depend
upon you? The old man begins late, but he is
bound to reform; and, if you but give your approbation,
there is no fear of his backsliding.</p>

<p><i>Johnny.</i> I say, dad, hadn’t you better put a postscript
to that?</p>

<p><i>Silas.</i> Well, what is&mdash; (<span class="smcap">Johnny</span> <i>whispers to him</i>.)
Exactly. There is no fear of his backsliding, unless, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
your request, he should some time set out for the purpose
of “Seeing the Elephant.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>The Elephant.</i> For this trick a well-known comical
diversion can be introduced. Bias and Pat personate the elephant;
one represents the fore, the other the hind legs. The
two characters bend over, placing themselves one behind the
other, as represented in the engraving. A blanket, doubled three
or four times, is placed on their backs, with the addition of long
cushions, if handy; these serve to form the back of the elephant.
Two blankets or shawls are placed over this, the end of one
twisted to represent his trunk, the end of the other twisted to
represent his tail. Two paper cones enact the tusks, and the
elephant is complete.</p>
